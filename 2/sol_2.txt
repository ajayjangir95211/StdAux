Question-2
How to pass an array using call by value in C ? Assuming array is declared locally that is inside main() ?


In C, an array is passed by reference. To pass an array using call by value we can make a new copy of array in called function and make changes to that array.
We can also use const keyword in called function declaration to avoid making changes in original array.



Sample code is : sol_2.c


Use following command for exection...
gcc sol_2.c -o sol_2 && ./sol_2
