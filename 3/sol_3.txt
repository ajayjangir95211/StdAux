Question-3
Which line will show error and why?
#include<stdio.h>
int main(){
char *a = "India";
char b[] = "India";
a = a+1;//line 5
b = b+1;//line 6
}


line 6 will give error because it is trying to assing name of array(b) to a new address. In C, an array name is not a modifiable left value. If we want to modify a pointer
we should use a pointer variable like *a, that's why line 5 does not give any error.

Sample code is : sol_3.c

Use following command for exection...
gcc sol_3.c -o sol_3 && ./sol_3
